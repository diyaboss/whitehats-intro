Why I want to join WhiteHats
I want to join WhiteHats because im in cybersec and I want to do more than regular college coursework. I want to learn practical security skills, do real life work, and be around people who are interested in hacking and building cool things. I have not done proper hacking projects yet, but I have tried CTFs before and really enjoyed them, so I want to explore this seriously.Also because this is a new club and theres so much room for all of us to grow so i feel like its gonna be very cool eventually and kinda envied? and when that happens i wanna be part of the board not an outsider

One cybersecurity news/incident I recently read
A major cyber incident reported in dec 2025 was gps spoofing affecting aircraft navigation signals at seven major airports, including Delhi and Mumbai. Authorities said contingency measures were used, and no major disruptions happened. I found this important because it shows cyber threats now affect critical infrastructure and public safety, not just personal accounts or websites.
